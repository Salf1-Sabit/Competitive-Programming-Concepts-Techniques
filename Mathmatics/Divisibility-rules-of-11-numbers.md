# Divisibility rules of first 11 numbers (including 0)

## When a number is divisible by 0?

Zero is divisible by everything

## When a number is divisible by 1?

All numbers are divisible by 1

## When a number is divisible by 2?

Every even number is divisible by 2. That is, any number that ends with 2, 4, 6, 8, or 0 will give 0 as the remainder when divided by 2.

    For example, 12, 46, and 780 are all divisible by 2.

## When a number is divisible by 3?

If the sum of the digits of a number is divisible by 3, then the number as a whole would also be divisible by 3.

    Consider a number, 308. To check whether 308 is divisible by 3 or not, take sum of the digits (i.e. 3+0+8= 11).

## When a number is divisible by 4?

If the last two digits of a number are divisible by 4, then that number is a multiple of 4 and is divisible by 4 completely.

    Example: Take the number 2308. Consider the last two digits i.e. 08. As 08 is divisible by 4, the original number 2308 is also divisible by 4.

## When a number is divisible by 5?

The divisibility rule of 5 states that if the digit on the units place, that is, the last digit of a given number is 5 or 0, then such a number is divisible by 5.

    For example, in 39865, the last digit is 5, hence, the number is completely divisible by 5.

## When a number is divisible by 6?

The number is divisible by 6 if it is divisible by both 2 and 3. <br/>
To check the divisibility of a number by 2 the last place should have an even number and the sum of the digits of the number should be divisible by 3. <br/>
If the number is not divisible by either 2 or 3 then it would not be divisible by 6.

    Take the example of number 136582. In this number at the unit place, there is 2 which is, even so, making it divisible by 2.

    To check the divisibility by 3 we add all the digits 1, 3, 6, 5, 8, and 2 which will result in 25 which is not divisible by 3.

    So the number 136582 is not divisible by 6. This is so because to be divisible by 6, the number should be divisible by both 2 and 3.

## When a number is divisible by 7?

The divisibility rule of 7 states that, if a number is divisible by 7, then “the difference between twice the unit digit of the given number and the remaining part of the given number should be a multiple of 7 or it should be equal to 0”.

For example, 798 is divisible by 7.

    The unit digit of 798 is 8.

    If the unit digit is doubled, we get 16 (i.e., 8 x 2 = 16)

    The remaining part of the given number is 79.

    Now, take the difference between 79 and 16.

    = 79-16

    = 63

    Here, the difference value obtained is 63, which is a multiple of 7. (i.e., 9 x 7 = 63)

    Thus, the given number 798 is divisible by 7.

## When a number is divisible by 8?

A number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits are divisible by 8.

    For example, 880 and 905,256 are divisible by 8 but 74,513 is not divisible by 8.

    To check divisibility by 8, divide the last three digits of the number by 8. If the result is a whole number, then the original number is divisible by 8.

## When a number is divisible by 9?

The rule for divisibility by 9 is similar to divisibility rule for 3. That is, if the sum of digits of the number is divisible by 9, then the number itself is divisible by 9.

    Example: Consider 78532, as the sum of its digits (7+8+5+3+2) is 25, which is not divisible by 9, hence 78532 is not divisible by 9.

## When a number is divisible by 10?

Divisibility rule for 10 states that any number whose last digit is 0, is divisible by 10.

    Example: 10, 20, 30, 1000, 5000, 60000, etc.
